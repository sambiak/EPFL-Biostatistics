# Statistical test tentative

# Explanation :
# In order to compare two means of two different populations of supposed equal variances, we use the t-test.
# When variances are not equal, we use the Welch's t-test.
# By default, unless you precise it, R perform Welch's t-test when you type t-test(x,y)

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  Data$yearly_conflict by Data$dummy
t = -1.2102, df = 35.739, p-value = 0.2342
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.17173745  0.04339882
sample estimates:
mean in group 0 mean in group 1 
      0.2272381       0.2914074 
      
# Null hypothesis is that the two means are equal
# Probability of null hypothesis is p = 0.2342 which is REALLY HIGH. We should have at least p < 0.10
# We can't conclude from this result that there is a difference statistically significant between the two mean
# However that is not what the paper says.
