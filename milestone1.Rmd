## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Introduction

In US labor policies, union security agreement is an agreement where an employer and a labor union agree on what extent employees have to join the labor union and/or either if the employers will collect fees for this participation.
In consequences, employees may be forced to join labor union as a condition for hiring, and to pay for representation. This means that in order to work, you have to pay.

Right-to-work laws prohibit such union security agreement.  It is adopted in some states, called « Right-to-work states », and not in others, called « union-shop states ».
However we can suppose that in right-to-work states, employees can be poorly represented. That is what defenders of union-shop states says, and that in right-to-work states, wages are lower, and poverty rate and mortality at work rate are higher.

Right-to-work laws were questionned many times. A major claim to justify their usefulness is that work hours lost in stoppages in some states were lessened thanks to the law.
The purpose of this study is to assess whether this statement is true, and if there is any correlation between right-to-work laws and industrial conflict.
